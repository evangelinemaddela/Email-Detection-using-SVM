# Email Detection Project

## Project Overview

This project focuses on detecting and translating emails using machine learning techniques and natural language processing (NLP) tools. The primary objective is to build a sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) model that translates English sentences to Hindi. The project utilizes various libraries such as TensorFlow, Keras, NLTK, and visualization tools like Matplotlib and Seaborn.

## Installation

## Explanation

### Data Manipulation and Visualization

The project begins with importing essential libraries for data manipulation (Numpy, Pandas) and visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn). These tools help in exploring and understanding the dataset, cleaning the data, and visualizing patterns and insights.

### Natural Language Processing

NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) is used for various NLP tasks such as removing stopwords and processing text data. Stopwords are common words that are usually removed from text data as they do not provide significant meaning for analysis (e.g., "the", "is", "in").

### Seq2Seq Model

The core of the project is a sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) model implemented using TensorFlow and Keras. This model is designed for tasks like language translation, where an input sequence (English sentence) is translated into an output sequence (Hindi sentence). The model architecture includes:

- *Encoder*: Processes the input sequence and encodes it into a fixed-length context vector.
- *Decoder*: Takes the context vector and generates the output sequence.

### Model Training

The model is trained on paired sequences of English and Hindi sentences. During training, the model learns to map the patterns and structures of English sentences to their corresponding Hindi translations.

### Inference Setup

After training, the model is set up for inference to predict translations for new English sentences. The inference process involves encoding the input sequence and then using the decoder to generate the translation step-by-step until the end of the sentence is reached.

### Decoding Sequences

A function is defined to decode the input sequence and generate the translated output. This involves predicting one word at a time and updating the state until the entire sentence is translated.

### Sample Output

The model is tested with sample input sentences to evaluate its performance. For example, given an English sentence "server", the model might predict its Hindi translation as "सर्वर".

## Usage

To use the project, run the scripts in the scripts/ directory or use the Jupyter notebooks in the notebooks/ directory for interactive exploration and visualization of the data and model.
